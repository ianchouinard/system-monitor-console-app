# system-monitor-console-app
Testing out java by building a simple console app.

## Info
This program will query your system for some basic memory and CPU usage stats (done with com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean). It will display the stats every 5 seconds. When the user terminates the program (done by pressing enter), the recorded max and min values for memory and cpu are displayed.
